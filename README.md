# NextJS Continuous Choosing

The app allows you to easily change it to your needs and make continuous choosing app by yourself, it scales ok to a certain degree. Made with attention to detail.

## How to use?

Change values in item-lists files, and change dependencies on different choices in render-buttons and the bottom of the file. It might take a while to figure out what to change, but you will get there for sure.

If you have any questions / tips for me hit me up anywhere.

Have fun testing.
